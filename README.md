## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: 
- **Experiment with other HTML tags**ï¼š First of all, I use <div> tags to seperate different sections of the website and make them organize. I also use <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, and <p> tags to indicate different kinds of info. For courses taken so far, I use <table> since there is relatively large amount info in this section and I make it as clear as possible; for experience section, I use<ul> and <pre> since I want to pre-format the spaces between items in the list.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
